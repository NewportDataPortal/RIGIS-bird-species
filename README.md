# RIGIS-bird-species  
These data are based on The Atlas of Breeding Birds in Rhode Island by Richard Enser (1992). Depicted within this dataset are breeding season species distribution of nesting birds throughout the state. This information was documented from 1982 to 1987 utilizing kilometer grid cell areas.

The attribute information associated with these data are extremely robust; all Rhode Island nesting bird species are included, and each has been coded as either confirmed (nesting evidence present), possible (single observation in siutable habitat with no nesting evidence present), probable (multiple sightings of species in suitable habitat with no nesting evidence) and not present (represents the absence of afforementioned options). Information is also provided on the number of confirmed species, number of possible species and number of probable species in each of the 166 grid cells.
